## Usage

     JellyAnim(jellyCount: jellyCount,
                radius: 20,
                viewPortSize: Size(200, 600),
                jellyCoordinates: 10,
                allowOverFlow: true,
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
                jellyPosition: JellyPosition.bottomCenter);

## Constructor Parameters

- `jellyCount` defines that how many jelly we want to overlap.

    -   NOTE: default value is 5 & user have to give more than 3.

- Inside the `viewPortSize` defined size the jelly will draw.
    - NOTE: by default the size of viewport is same as screen size.

- `colors` list of colors for transition if user will not give any color then it'll take random color.
